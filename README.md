# BMI2
This is an applet that I made years ago in JBuilder 8. 

The program is meant to calculate a new version of Body Mass Index, whil compensating for age, body structure and sex(male or female) and when the project halted, I was working om BMI for children of different ages.

I am very sorry(I think ;-) ) that the code is in Danish (comments, functions and viable names), but changing all the names and functions so long after I gave up the project would be a gigantic task and useless, as long I have no intension of finishing the Applet alone.

Also I have noticed that Java applets at no longer supported by Firefox and other browsers.

Perhaps porting the code to C++ culd be fun for someone out there.

For now, I offer the code for people to studie and perhaps use some of the solutiones within the code.
